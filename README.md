# Exercise

The goal of the project is to build a command line tool.

Using Go, write a command line tool that consumes the first `20` `even` numbered TODO's in most performant way and output the `title` and whether it is `completed` or not.

- TODO at index 1 can be accessed at: <https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1>

- TODO at index 2 can be accessed at: <https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/2>

Ensure you are submitting the code along with cli.
